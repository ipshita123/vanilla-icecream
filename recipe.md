Gather the ingredients.

In a blender, combine the soymilk, soymilk powder, and water until well blended.

Combine the soymilk mixture with the sugar, vanilla, and vinegar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stirring constantly, cook until the mixture is thick and syrupy in consistency.

Pour the mixture into a 9-by-5-inch metal loaf pan or other medium-sized metal or aluminum pan.

Place the pan in the freezer uncovered for 1 hour.

Remove the pan from the freezer and scrape the ice cream into a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, or until mixture is creamy.

Place the mixture back in the pan and back into the freezer.

Repeat this procedure 3 more times at 30-minute intervals, allowing the ice cream to chill in the freezer covered for 1 hour after the last blend before serving.

Serve ice cream cold, adding your choice of toppings if desired.
